##### Adjust Font Size
###### The built-in font size spinner lets users easily increase or decrease the font size for better readability.
##### Change Font Color
######  The editor includes a color picker that allows users to change the color of the text to any color of their choice.
##### Select Different Fonts
######  Users can select from a wide variety of fonts provided by the system, offering customization in text appearance.
##### Scrollable Text Area
###### The text area is equipped with a scroll pane, allowing users to work with longer documents without losing track of the text.
##### Line Wrap Feature
