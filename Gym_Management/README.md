## Overview
A Java-based Gym Management System designed to automate routine gym tasks like member registration, coach assignment, and payment processing. It integrates with MySQL for data storage and retrieval, offering a smooth and efficient user experience.


------------



## Key Features
##### User Authentication
###### The system includes a secure login mechanism that verifies users before granting access to the dashboard and other features.
##### Interactive Dashboard
###### Users are presented with a dashboard that provides key metrics such as the number of active members, total coaches, and daily income.
##### Database Integration
###### The system connects to a MySQL database for persistent data storage, ensuring that all records are securely saved and easily retrievable.
##### Role-Based Access Control
###### Different levels of access are provided based on user roles, with administrators having full access and regular users limited to their own data.
##### Member / Coach Management
###### Administrators can add, update, delete members and coaches records, including personal details like name, age, contact information, and membership status.
##### Coach Assignment
###### The system allows administrators to assign members to specific coaches, ensuring that each coach has an updated roster of members to train.

## User Manual
</div>

####  Requirements
###### Java Version
The game requires `Java 8` or higher to run. You can check your `Java` version by running below command:
```bash
$ java -version
```
###### JavaFX
If you are running the game from source code, make sure `JavaFX` is installed and configured.You can do that by running below command:
- for DPKG-based systems::
```bash
# You can check if JavaFX is installed by searching for its package:
dpkg -l | grep openjfx
```
-  for RPM-based systems:
```bash
rpm -qa | grep openjfx
```
- For Windows and macOS:
  There is no specific package manager, but you can check if you have the `javafx` libraries downloaded under your project or JDK installation directories.

#### Getting Started
###### To run a program, you need to:
- Clone this repository
 ```bash
$ git clone <repository_url>
```
###### If you're using the executable file:
- Double-click the executable file (`GymManagementSystem.jar`) to launch the game.
- If the executable does not open via double-click, run the following command from the terminal/command prompt:
```bash
$  java -jar GymManagementSystem.jar
```
###### If you're running from Source Code
- Open the project in your preferred  `IDE` (e.g. IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse).
- Make sure you have `MySQL` set up and the database schema loaded (details on how to set up the database can be found in the `Database Setup` section).
- Run the `Main.java` class located in the `application.gymmanagementsystem` package to launch the game.

#### Database Setup
###### MySQL
- Install `MySQL` on your local machine.
- Create a new database and import the provided SQL schema file (`gym_management.sql`) from the repository to set up the required tables.
- Update the `Database.java` file with your MySQL credentials (username, password, database name) to ensure proper connectivity:
```java
$ String url = "jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/your_database_name";
$ String user = "your_username";
$ String password = "your_password";
```
> If your getting error while trying to start `mysql.service` try `sudo systemctl restart httpd.service`

##### Customization
###### Changing the Application Theme
The application's look and feel can be customized by modifying the `CSS` stylesheets used in the `JavaFX` user interface.

**Steps to make the change:**
1. Navigate to the resources folder in the project structure.
2. Locate the `style.css` file.
3. Modify the `CSS` properties to change colors, fonts, button styles, etc. For example, to change the background color of the dashboard, update:
```css
.dashboard 
{
    -fx-background-color: #f0f0f0; /* Change this value to your desired color */
}
```
You can also replace the `CSS` file with a new one to implement a completely different theme.

###### Changing the Logo or Branding
You can change the logo displayed in the application to fit your gymâ€™s branding.

**Steps to make the change:**
1. Navigate to the resources folder and locate the `logo.png` file.
2. Replace the `logo.png` file with your own image.
3. Ensure the new image file has the same dimensions as the original, or modify the layout constraints in the `FXML` file that handles the logo:
```xml
<ImageView fx:id="logoImage" fitWidth="150" fitHeight="150" />
```

###### Customizing Member or Coach Data Fields
The system currently stores predefined data for members and coaches. You can add or remove fields depending on your needs.

**Steps to make the change:**
1. Update the database schema to include the new field. For example, to add a `membership_level` field to members, alter the members table:
```sql
$ ALTER TABLE members ADD membership_level VARCHAR(50);
```
2. Modify the `MemberData.java` or `CoachData.java` classes to reflect the new field:
```java
$ private String membershipLevel;
```
3. Update the user interface in the corresponding `FXML` files to include input forms for the new field.
4. Modify the `SQL` queries in `Database.java` to handle the new field when adding, updating, or deleting records.
