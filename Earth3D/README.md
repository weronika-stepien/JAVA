## Overview
A 3D Earth simulation project built in JavaFX. It features a detailed model of Earth with geographic textures, dynamic lighting, and terrain elevation. The simulation allows for full user interaction, including mouse-controlled rotation and zooming.


------------



## Key Features
##### Mouse-Controlled Rotation
###### Users can rotate the Earth in any direction by clicking and dragging the mouse, allowing for a full 360-degree exploration of the globe.
##### Zoom Functionality
###### A vertical slider lets users zoom in and out, giving them control over how closely they want to view the 3D Earth model.
##### Terrain Elevation Mapping
###### Bump mapping is used to depict mountains, valleys, and other terrain features, providing a realistic three-dimensional effect on the Earth's surface.
##### Dynamic Lighting Effect
###### The simulation includes real-time lighting effects that simulate sunlight and shadow on the Earth's surface.
##### Illumination Map
###### The application uses an illumination map that simulates artificial lighting from cities, making the night side of the Earth glow with lights from urban areas.
##### Perspective Camera
###### The simulation uses a perspective camera to give users a realistic view of the Earth, with a sense of depth and scale as they rotate and zoom in.

## User Manual
</div>

####  Requirements
###### Java Version
The game requires `Java 8` or higher to run. You can check your `Java` version by running below command:
```bash
$ java -version
```
###### JavaFX
If you are running the game from source code, make sure `JavaFX` is installed and configured.You can do that by running below command:
- for DPKG-based systems::
```bash
# You can check if JavaFX is installed by searching for its package:
dpkg -l | grep openjfx
```
-  for RPM-based systems:
```bash
rpm -qa | grep openjfx
```
- For Windows and macOS:
  There is no specific package manager, but you can check if you have the `javafx` libraries downloaded under your project or JDK installation directories.

#### Getting Started
###### To run a program, you need to:
- Clone this repository
 ```bash
$ git clone <repository_url>
```
###### If you're using the executable file:
- Double-click the executable file (`Earth3D.jar`) to launch the game.
- If the executable does not open via double-click, run the following command from the terminal/command prompt:
```bash
$  java -jar Earth3D.jar
```
###### If you're running from Source Code
- Open the project in your preferred `Java IDE` (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse).
- Run the `Application.java` class located in the `application.earth3d` package to launch the game.

| 1 | Cloud Layer        | Work in progress | Adding a cloud layer that moves independently of the Earthâ€™s surface, providing a more realistic view of the planet's atmosphere. |
| 2 | Zoom Slider Glitch | Bug              | The zoom slider may occasionally become unresponsive or "jump" to extremes when dragged quickly.                                  |
